        <br>
        Doraemon is sent back in time by a young boy named Sewashi Nobi to improve the circumstances of his great-great-grandfather, Nobita, so that his descendants may enjoy a better future. In the original timeline, Nobita experienced nothing but misery and misfortune manifested in the form of very poor grades and bullying throughout his life. This culminates in the burning down of a future business he sets up which leaves his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter history and better the Nobi family's fortunes, Sewashi initially wanted to send a super-robot to protect Nobita, but with his meager allowance he could only afford an imperfectly-made factory-rejected toy: an anthropomorphic robot cat called Doraemon.

Doraemon was created on 3 September 2112 by the Matsushiba Robot Factory (マツシバ • ロボット • 工場).[12] He has a fourth-dimensional pocket (四次元ポケット) from which he pulls out food, money, medicines, desserts and most of all, gadgets from the future. The 1995 short film, 2112: The Birth of Doraemon, shows his original appearance; when he was first manufactured, Doraemon had ears and was painted yellow, but he turned blue after sobbing because rats ate his ears.[7] According to the 1995 short film, he is coated and scented with eggs, which gave him the yellow skin color.[13]
